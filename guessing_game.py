#Description: Good olâ€™ Guessing Game - Assignment 3 - I imported the random package to select a random integer from 1 to 100. Then I take the guess as an input.
#The while loop checks if the number of chances is less than 10 as the player has only 10 chances.
#The first if statement checks if the guess is not equal to the number and if the guess is higher than number but less than 100 then it shows a message 'too high'
#The elif statement checks if guess is not equal to the number and if the guess is less than the number but above 0 then it shows a message 'too low'
#2nd elif statement checks if the guess is equal to the random number and then displays the messages while also showing the number of chances taken by the player.
#3rd elif statement checks if the guess is less than or equal to 0 then it asks the player to enter the next guess.
#4th elif statement checks if the guess is above 100 then it asks the player to enter the next guess. 
#The else statement is executed once the player has extinguished all their 10 chances and it displays the correct number.
